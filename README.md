## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework
- [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) - Third-Party Hosted Service for real-time bi-directional communication

### What I learned

This project was an amazing opportunity to utilize NextJS and TailwindCSS to build upon UI/UX concepts. Initially, I only intended to play against a bot, however, I wanted to share this project with friends and family. In the process, I expanded the scope to include a "Play with Friend" mode which required real-time bi-directional communication through websockets.

### Continued development

I plan to continue adding features to this project to enhance the user experience. I think starting with some onClick sound effects will be a great place to start.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
